# ECommerce---Market-Mix-Model

## Business Problem
- A revenue dip observed even after spending a significant amount of money on marketing and promotions.
- There was a high customer churn ratio because the company was failing to understand customer
demographics and cater their needs.
- There was no mobile app for a satisfactory shopping experience and the website had a confusing interface
with incomplete product details making it difficult for the customers to easily locate what they are looking
for.
- Low order conversion rate.
- The budgets planned were not as impactful as expected, and the CFO was quite unhappy with the turnover
rates. 

## Solution Planned
- To develop a Market Mix Model with the help of which the company can optimize the budget allocation
and utilization for marketing through various channels such as TV, Digital etc and to identify the
important KPIs through which Eleckart can drive for more revenue
